# 👋 Hi, I'm Sean!

I'm a **PhD student in Natural Language Processing (NLP)** at Durham University focussing on applying big data to tackle antimicrobial resistance and other critical public health threats in veterinary medicine

## 🌟 Current Projects
- **PetBERT**: A veterinary-focused transformer model for analyzing free-text electronic health records (EHR).
- Investigating **diagnostic certainty** and **antimicrobial resistance** using 10M+ animal EHRs in collaboration with SAVSNET.
- Exploring the **correlation between antimicrobial use and behavioral changes** in animals.

## 🎓 Academic Highlights
- Published my first paper as an undergrad, featured in my university's newspaper.
- Teaching NLP to master's students, from **beginner Python coders** to advanced computer science cohorts.
- Active in workshops and conferences like ACL, focusing on applied bio NLP.

## 💡 Interests
- **Sentence transformers** and their use in domain-specific NLP tasks.
- Enhancing **ICD-11 classification** with word embeddings and transformers.
- **Causal language modeling** to uncover hidden relationships in healthcare data.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- Programming: Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers
- Data Science: Big Data Processing, Named Entity Recognition, Multi-Label Classification
- Research: Statistical Analysis, Ethical Data Usage, Applied Bio NLP
